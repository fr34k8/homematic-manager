<!--
    Task 34 (#147, D-42). The auto-acknowledge hangs on the edge of a STICKY_UNREACH, so a message
    that was in the list before the option was switched on - the reporter's case, his messages were
    older than his first connection - stayed there for good. Whether those go too is the user's
    call, because acknowledging is a write and the list is what shows which devices were away; so
    this asks, once, when the switch goes on with such messages present, and says what is lost and
    where it is kept. The app's own dialog, stacked over the settings (never `window.confirm`).
